# Automobile Data Analysis and Model Development

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing automobile data, performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developing a predictive model to gain insights into vehicle attributes and pricing trends.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project consists of four key notebooks:

1. **Data Cleaning (`DATA_CLEANING_AUTOMOBILE.ipynb`)**  
   - Handles missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies
   - Standardizes column names and data types
   - Prepares data for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (`EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS_AUTOMOBILE.ipynb`)**  
   - Performs statistical analysis on key variables
   - Visualizes relationships between features
   - Identifies patterns and insights

3. **Model Development (`MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_AUTOMOBILE.ipynb`)**  
   - Builds and evaluates machine learning models for prediction
   - Fine-tunes model parameters for better accuracy

4. **Model Evaluation (`MODEL_EVALUATION_AND_REFINEMENT_AUTOMOBILE.ipynb`)**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.
   - Includes matrix visualization and model refinement strategies.


## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model development)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd automobile-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you create a requirements file
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
